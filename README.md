# About me

I graduated from the University of Bristol with a distinction in MSc Economics and Data Science, following on from achieving a First in BA Economics from the University of Leicester. It was during my studies where I was introduced to using tools such as Python and R to extract answers to complex questions from large datasets, and then convey those findings in clear and concise ways. This then led me to join The Information Lab as a Data Analytics Consultant.

Whilst working at The Information Lab, I have:

- Spoken at the 2024 Higher Education Tableau User Group where I presented an automated solution to batch exporting and sharing Tableau views with appropriate filters applied by leveraging the Tableau REST API with Alteryx

- Published 18 blog posts covering various topics that range from transforming statsbomb football analytics data in Alteryx to the considerations required to improve the accesibility and inclusivity of dashboards in Tableau

- Passed several certifications including Tableau Certified Data Analyst and Alteryx Designer Advanced

# Tech stack

- Tableau Desktop

- Tableau Server

- Alteryx Designer

- Alteryx Server

- SQL (Snowflake, PostgreSQL, Oracle)

# Tableau Public

This dashboard allows the user to select a football player and evaluate how they compare amongst others at progressing the ball into dangerous areas of the pitch and in which zones they excell at doing so. Data is from [statsbomb](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data) and cleaned and transformed using Alteryx.
